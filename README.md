creating a ai assistance to playing blackjack(using AI to help you ween)
rules of blackjack:
    objective: get closer than the dealer to 21
    in this game all cards not including jokers(13*4=52) have value
    the value of the 2-10 cards are the same as their number 
    the values of k(king),Q(qeen),j(jack) are 10
    the value of the ass(1) is 11 or 1 the better one to the obj
    each turn the user will bet on money and get 2 shown cards,
    after that the dealer gets 2 cards too but only one is shown(i used passive OMG):) 
    the user will choose to take another card or not when he choose not to take another card
    the dealer will expose the card and take another cards until he will get value 17 and above
    there can be 4 outcomes:
        - user win- the user has a vlue clooser to 21= multyply the money he puts(put 2 dollar get another 2)
        - user win blackjack- the user gets from his 2 first cards a value of 21= the user multyply the money by 2.5(gets 1.5 more)
        - tie- the dealer and user values are the same as the=the user and dealer dont get anything
        - dealer win- the dealer has a vlue clooser to 21=the dealer takes the money
the plan is to first create the game blackjack than create as a user the AI to help us cheat
